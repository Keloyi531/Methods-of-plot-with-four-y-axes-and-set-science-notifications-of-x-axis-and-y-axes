###It's an adapted version based on the function "move_sn_y()" from a blog of "werthmuller.org", link: https://werthmuller.org/blog/2014/move-scientific-notation/

I had a trouble: the scientific notification of the secondary y-axis and third y-axis overlap when using parasite axis to plot multiple datasets, 
and functions such as "ax.get_xaxis().get_offset_text().set_position((0,0))" and the "move_sn_y()" seems can't work on the plot with multiple y axes.
So I'm decided to adapt the function today, wish me good luck.

And I am not yet proficient in using Github.
