Prenotice:
The founction in this code is based on the function "move_sn_y()" from a blog of "werthmuller.org", link: https://werthmuller.org/blog/2014/move-scientific-notation/.
And also based on the matplotlib tutorial.

Once I need to illustrate the experimental data and need to plot a graph with four y-axes, but the y-ticks were overlaped on the second y-axis because of the extra fourth y-axis. At that time, the answer that could solve the overlap problem of double y-axis can't solve my problem. In another way, it can be solved by erase the overlaped ticks by PS, but I want to solve this problem fundamentally.

So I modified the code continuously and even tried to modify the source code of the functions, so confused. Once by a mistake, I found that
